# Crypto App

I attempted to develop the app in Angular according to a predefined set of tasks. While it's not entirely finished, there are still several features that require rewriting or completion. Also, it's not responsive, except on the login page.
‚ùóIMPORTANT: note that Mozilla Firefox doesn't support the color transition animation yet I've implemented.

## Start

After cloning it and installing all the necessary packages with npm, you can start it by running ng s -o.

```bash
  npm i
  ng s -o
```
