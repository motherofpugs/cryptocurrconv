# Crypto App

I tried to implement the app based on a predetermined set of tasks in Angular. It's not completely finished yet, there are a few features that need to be rewritten or completed.
‚ùóIMPORTANT: note that Mozilla Firefox doesn't support the color transition animation yet I've implemented.

## Start

After cloning it and installing all the necessary packages with npm, you can start it by running ng s -o.

```bash
  npm i
  ng s -o
```
